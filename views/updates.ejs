              <p>
                <blockquote>If my books can help children become readers, then I feel I have accomplished something important.</blockquote>
                – Roald Dahl.
              </p>
              <p>
                He came, he wrote, he left us spellbound, and he left. His books, however, remain just as they were- succulently satisfying works, unparalleled in the field of children’s literature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The magic of Roald Dahl has lasted. Matilda still inspires every young child who picks up the book, Mr. Fox is as fantastic as ever, and The Witches can yet terrify and enchant any child. Mr. Twit’s beard is as revolting, Danny is still the champion, just as Quentin Blake’s illustrations are absolutely spot-on.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s evident that Roald Dahl was all about stories. He was nothing spectacular at English in school, but the love for literature was infused in him by a certain lady. During his time at boarding school, this lady- a Mrs. O’Connor- was hired to baby-sit the boys as the masters made their way to the pub every Saturday morning. Each week, she would pick a writer and talk about his life and works. The boys absolutely adored her. As she covered excerpts from the greatest texts in English literature, Roald became irrevocably immersed. And, he began to read.

              <p>
                His works never stopped promoting books and the joys of reading. Let’s take a look at five quotes from his children’s tales which delve into language, books and reading.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <blockquote><b>"So, please, oh please, we beg, we pray, go throw your TV set away, and in its place you can install, a lovely bookcase on the wall."</b></blockquote>
                  This is from one of the many songs sung by the Oompa Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and this particular piece was directed at the (aptly named) character of Mike Teevee. It mocks the obsession with television which has caused children to neglect reading.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <blockquote><b>"I'm wondering what to read next." Matilda said. "I've finished all the children's books."</b></blockquote>
                  The first sense of completion as Matilda wonders what to read next. At four years old, she takes on Great Expectations. We all can’t be prodigies, but don’t we all feel slightly lost when we realize that we’ve graduated from one section of the library?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <blockquote><b>"Don't gobblefunk around with words."</b></blockquote>
                  In The BFG, the titular giant is a lovable character with an idiosyncratic style of speaking- he goes by a Jumbly vocabulary of his own (called Gobblefunk by RD), and tangles up his sentences. Either way, he is a Gloriumptious fellow, and BFG’s language goes a long way to attract children to the joys of English as well as to portray his relationship with other characters in the book.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <blockquote><b>"The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went on olden-day sailing ships with Joseph Conrad. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling. She travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in an English village."</b></blockquote>
                  If you read, you can travel the world by sitting in one place, and that is precisely what Matilda does. Roald Dahl evokes the sublimity of literature and shows how reading not only widens perspective, but also opens windows to skies which seemed impossible to fly before.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <blockquote><b>"If you are going to get anywhere in life you have to read a lot of books."</b></blockquote>
                  Clearly, Dahl is seeking to pass on the message- reading takes you places. We all are indebted to the books that have shaped us since we were young human beans (as the BFG would put it) and it’s the least we can do to pass on the gift.
