        <li>Teacher Volunteers are the backbone of The WordsWorth Project. We open up applications for the volunteer positions primarily in June and December of each year for all the centres across Delhi. However, we do open up applications for specific teacher volunteer positions on a need basis in the middle of the year.</li>
        <li>We also look out for volunteers in the core team for specific projects throughout the year. These projects require specific skills in various fields such as documentation, film making, graphic designing etc.</li>
