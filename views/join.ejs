However, we do open up applications for specific teacher volunteer positions on a need basis in the middle of the year. <b>Volunteer applications for January 2015 are now closed.</b> We also look out for volunteers in the core team for specific projects throughout the year. These projects require specific skills in various fields such as documentation, film making, graphic designing etc.</div>
